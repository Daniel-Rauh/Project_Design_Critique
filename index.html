        <h1>Deliverables</h1>
        <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
        <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
        <h3>Design Report</h3>
        <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.</p>
        <h3>Ways to Redesign</h3>
        <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
